# Fall CSCI 3320 Syllabus Addendum

This course is governed by my [general syllabus](https://github.com/bricksphd/teaching/blob/master/Syllabus.md) with the following updates.

## In-Person & Remote Schedule
Students will be expected to attend class Monday, Wednesday, and Friday promptly at noon. Attendance will be taken. Due to COVID restrictions, students will only be able to attend in-person once a week. The other days students will be expected to attend the course remotely during the assigned course time. 

Since the course will be taught across three days a week instead of two, the duration of class times will be shorter than the standard 75 minutes. The first 35 minutes of class will be dedicated to instructional material. At the end of the first 35 minutes of class those attending remotely will be dismissed. For those attending in-person, the remaining 40 minutes of class will be in-class lab time with the instructor. 

Students will be assigned into one of three groups: A, B, and C, with the following attendance requirements:

| Group/Weekday 	| Monday    	| Monday Time    	| Wednesday 	| Wednesday Time 	| Friday    	| Friday Time    	|
|---------------	|-----------	|----------------	|-----------	|----------------	|-----------	|----------------	|
| Group A       	| In-Person 	| Noon-1:15PM  	| Remote    	| Noon-12:35PM 	| Remote    	| Noon-12:35PM 	|
| Group B       	| Remote    	| Noon-12:35PM 	| In-Person 	| Noon-1:15PM  	| Remote    	| Noon-12:35PM 	|
| Group C       	| Remote    	| Noon-12:35PM 	| Remote    	| Noon-12:35PM 	| In-Person 	| Noon-1:15PM  	|

Student group assignments will be posted on Canvas.

## Other Fall 2020-Specific Details:

- Additional office hours will be held from 10:30 to 11:45 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

- When students attend the course remotely, they are expected to do so in a professional manner. This includes turning their cameras on, and, if they choose to use a virtual background, to use one that is neither animated nor distracting to others. If students are unable to attend remotely using a camera, they should contact their instructor.

- The Bachelor of Science Information Systems (BIS) and Bachelor of Science Computer Science (BCS) Programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  This organization requires that we keep samples of student work.  Unless you specify otherwise, I may retain your exams and assignments for accreditation purposes and return a copy to you.

## Student Learning Objectives

### Understanding Data Structure
- Students will understand the details of the list, stack, queue, tree, heap, and hash-table  data structures.
- Students will be able to discuss different algorithms for sorting these data structures.
- Students will be able to discuss different algorithms for searching within these data structures.
- Students will be familiar with the greedy, dynamic programming, and backtracking problem solving strategies.
- Students will understand when to use each of these data structures to solve programming problems.

### Understanding Computational Complexity
- Students will be familiar efficiency in terms of time and storage space.
- Students will be able to compare algorithms in terms of their computational complexity.

### Implementing Computationally Efficient Data Structures
- Students will write programs that implement several of these data structures.
- Students will write programs that have a low computational complexity.
- Students will write programs using appropriate coding practices.
